# Joose Tabs

A lightweight, minimal and unstyled tab component.

This component belongs to the Joose component library, but can be used completely independently.

Please see [joose](https://github.com/scoobster17/joose) for the whole library / utils, as this currently is a dependency until I figure out two-way dependencies.

Not yet an npm or bower module
